# The Conqueror

The conqueror is a turn based empire building game where you first choose a city from 3 available cities: Cairo, Sparta and Rome.
The goal is to build an army to be able to conquer the other 2 cities within 50 turns. To be able to do that, you have to build and upgrade buildings that you build in your city to produce gold, food and recruit soldiers, and then set your army to go conquer other cities. Once you reach another city you can either besiege the city for 3 turns to lower their defenses or attack directly in which there are 2 modes: Auto-simulate and Manual fight
